<p>Energeon Data is a company which focuses on Energy Data which are for making Investment decisions in the Energy Sector, mainly Renewable and Sustainable Energy. The goal is simply not just do Data Science or Data Analytics, but it is also to build Data Science platform using Blockchain technology, to make an open but secure analytics platform built on top of Blockchain technology and make it available for Data Scientists to be able to sell their Analytics in the open market.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-energy-data"><strong>Why do we need Energy Data?</strong></h2>
<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_returned_on_energy_invested">EROI</a>(Energy Return on Investment) declines with traditional Energy sources such as Oil and Natural gas and fracking gas becomes expensive to extract and also causes Climate Change along with other environmental issues such as earthquakes, it’s obviously that a variety of technologies need to be incorporated to sustain the current levels of global growth.</p>

<p><em>Fig 1: Global and US Oil and Gas EROI</em><br>
<strong><em>Source</em>:</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513003856">EROI of different fuels and the implications for society</a></p>
<p>More than just EROI we also have polluted cities increasing and countries which are heavily dependent on old technologies to burn coal and oil products. This has unprecedented effect on human health mostly in emerging nations such as China and India which have been electrifying the villages and rural areas for the first time of their existence.</p>
<p>Alternative energy investments are also a hedge against geopolitical risk of sanctions, war, shortage of crude oil/natural gas or natural catastrophy to have access to alternative energy sources. So it’s is in national interest for many countries to prepare themselves in any kind of situation to be self-sustainable in a multi-polar world. This should not be seen as controversial as the dynamics of the cooperation changes between countries as they become ever less dependent on resources catering each other. Example: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/cooperation/india_en">EU-India Clean Development and Sustainable Energy</a>. The explanation and narrative is important to foster more support for investing in clean energy and this can be only backed by data.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to use decentralized energy sources such as Solar, Wind, Geothermal etc.</p>
<p>Many Oil and Gas companies have realized the potential of renewable and sustainable sources of energy, they have began investing in some of these companies. Just like oil and gas there are many different infrastructure needed for renewable energy and they are currently being built right now, for example, Electric chargers for Electric Vehicles, Solar Plant etc.</p>
<p>Analytics and Data Science gives us insights which are very nuanced and specific to the market scenario of a particular country or region we are dealing with. This is useful for investment decision making.</p>
<p>Many Hedge Funds and Insurance funds have started to focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_responsible_investing">Responsible investments</a> and they are concentrating on new paradigm on investments based on Environmental, Social and Governance modes, short form ESG.</p>
<p>CFA Institute, one of the premier Accreditation institutes for Financial Analysts has taken a survey amongst it’s alumni and members which has shown an <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/research/survey-reports/esg-survey-2017">increasing interest in ESG</a>.<br>
Some firms look at this as an edge or an advantage in investment strategies rather than a necessity to fulfill some regulatory obligations or look at it as a necessary structural change as resentment towards polluting organization or energy inefficient organization increases.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_data_(finance)">Alternative Data</a> for asset managers <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3c321c14-52d4-11e8-b24e-cad6aa67e23e">is a growing industry</a>, and renewable energy investments too need sound data for sound investments.</p>
<p>Another area to look at for alternative data is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0">Industry 4.0 initiative</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">Additive manufacturing</a> which will reduce time and energy to produce things and also in a very efficient manner and this is possible by having many data points. These are some of the important trends to monitor in global economics.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-blockchain"><strong>Why use Blockchain?</strong></h2>
<p>The most unique feature of Blockchain is that it’s a very good verification tool which is readily available and can scale globally and it’s immutable. Incentives built on top of Blockchain and the network effect of having 1000s or even millions of people taking part in a collective activity only reinforces the network growth and makes it stronger. Blockchain brings the network aspect to everything which needs to be incentivised.</p>
<p>And there is no other area which is in dire need for Blockchain than Energy which directly correlates with Climate Change and Pollution. Economic incentives can be directly built into the code with Blockchain and many projects are already underway doing this. It’s not just the mainstream companies. The need of the hour is the Capital support to fund the Energy projects, Cryptocurrency projects are now taking a huge leap forward with th ICO model funding futuristic projects which promised Blockchain with advanced features which can completely revolutionize the fields they promise to change.</p>
<p>Blockchain promises unique user accounts for each user where user is in full control, so they can perform their own transactions without the hassle of middle man.</p>
<p>We will not only seek for newer and more advanced Energy projects, but we will have the data to back up the claim of the success or failure of a particular project. This way we can focus on newer innovations and push the envelope.</p>
<p>We plan to use Steem as a main cryptocurrency platform, inspired by the Steemit Social Media, we will  build on the “Proof of Brain” concept or similar.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases-and-potential-customers"><strong>Use cases and potential customers</strong></h2>
<p>Some of the use cases for Blockchain based Data Marketplace and Data Science platform are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>ESG Rating Agency</li>
<li>Alternative Data Platform</li>
<li>Data Science Competitions</li>
<li>Investment platform</li>
<li>And many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential customers would be Quant hedge funds, investment banks, insurance firms etc. There were many significant ESG events such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP_Oil_Spill">BP Oil spill</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">Volkswagen Emissions Scandal</a> etc which made many firms shift their focus to these events as important deciding points on which they would invest.</p>
<h2 id="architecture"><strong>Architecture</strong></h2>
<p>This platform would be a combination of many existing technologies to host <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython#Project_Jupyter">Jupyter Notebook</a>. Those technologies include</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steem.io/steem-whitepaper.pdf">Steem</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For Data Marketplace, <a href="https://enigma.co/">Enigma</a> looks like a candidate which is scalable.</p>
<p>We don’t have to build a new crypto platform with consensus mechanism from ground up thanks to these existing and working architecture. We are going to build layers on the framework of Blockchain technology.</p>
